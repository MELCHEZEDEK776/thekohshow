# thekohshow
 I am going to make my full time job to promote SteemIT in the Streets! Guerilla marketing has been my passion for years. Walking up to strangers and engaging them in conversation always brings a new response.  @ackza and I are working to make flyer's and t-shirts. Luckily my girlfriend's family has a T-Shirt printing company so we can lower our costs. I'd like to send SteemIT t-shirts to all of our supporters!  If you would like to support us leave a comment below and give your ideas about what you would like to see from the Koh Show!  !@lovecoins will be securing and directing new users to the network by directly linking each patron to a single QR code that will link redirecting to our steemit/openledger exchange. They will be @Circuits and @Coinshocker  Hit us up if you'd like to show some love to this project.
